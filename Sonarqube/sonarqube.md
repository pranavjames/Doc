# SonarQube

- Code Coverage Percentage (> 80%): Ensures a high proportion of your code is tested, reducing bugs.
- Technical Debt Ratio (< 5%): Measures how much code needs refactoring for maintainability.
- Number of Bugs (Ideally 0): Counts coding errors needing fixes for functional integrity.
- Security Vulnerabilities (Minimal): Identifies potential security risks needing attention.
- Code Smells Count (Minimal): Detects 'smelly' code that may need improvement for better readability.
- Duplications Percentage (< 3%): Highlights repeated code blocks that should be simplified.
- Security Hotspots Reviewed (100%): Ensures all potential security risks are examined.
- Complexity Metrics (Cyclomatic Complexity < 10): Evaluates how complicated the code is, aiming for simplicity.
- Coding Rules Compliance (Close to 100%): Shows adherence to set coding standards for quality.
- Quality Gate Status (Passed): Indicates the overall health of the codebase, based on set criteria.
